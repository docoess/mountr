# Mountr

Mountr is my take on a light social media application aimed specifically at World of Warcraft players. Even more specific than that, the true demographic is mount collectors in WoW.

Users can post pictures of mounts they own with short captions. They can also comment on other users' posts or flag a post as a wanted mount for themselves.

My favorite part of the application for a major mount collector like myself is the profile page. On this page, using OAuth2.0 you can connect to Battle.net and retrieve your actual mount collection.
A list will be populated with every mount Blizzard's servers say you own. If your collection ever increases in size, a quick re-import is all that is needed to update the list.

The profile page is also a quick way to see all mounts from other user posts you have flagged as wanted.
